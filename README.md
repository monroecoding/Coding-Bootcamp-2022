Coding Bootcamp at the Monroe Township Library

Hey!

All files for the Coding Bootcamp, including any slides, coding examples, and projects, will be uploaded here. I'll split them up by the date of each class. Click on the 'branches' dropdown and select which class notes you want to view. You can download all the files as a zip folder, or just view individual files. When completing projects it may be easier to just copy and paste the code into your editor. If you're not comfortable/familiar with using Github, you can just email me at cdifazio@monroetpl.org and I can send them to you directly.
