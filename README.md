# Coding-Bootcamp-2022
Coding Bootcamp at the Monroe Township Library

Hey!

All files for the Coding Bootcamp, including any slides, coding examples, and projects, will be uploaded here.
I'll split them up by the date of each class. You can download or clone.
If you're not comfortable/familiar with using Github, you can just email me at cdifazio@monroetpl.org and I can send them to you directly.
