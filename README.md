# Coding-Bootcamp-2022
Coding Bootcamp at the Monroe Township Library

Hey!

All files for the Coding Bootcamp, including any slides, coding examples, and projects, will be uploaded here.
I'll split them up by the date of each class. Click on the 'branches' dropdown and select which class notes you want to view. Then you can download individual files, or the whole thing as a zip file.
If you're not comfortable/familiar with using Github, you can just email me at cdifazio@monroetpl.org and I can send them to you directly.
