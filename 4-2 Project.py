A 'Caesar Cipher' is a simple type of encryption that shifts the letters of a message
forward across the alphabet using a specific key
For example, 'hello' shifted with a key of 3, would become 'khoor'

Write a program that can encrypt or decrypt a message using the Caesar cipher
The main program will ask the user to input a message and either encrypt or decrypt that message

Complete the encypt() and decrypt() functions
Both functions will accept a message as an argument, decrypt() takes a key argument also
Each character of the message should be shifted forward (encryption) or backward (decryption)
by the value of the key

Things to remember:
    - For simplicity, all messages will be converted to uppercase in the main() function before being passed as arguments
    - Make sure your program can account for messages with numbers or non-alpha characters
    - You will need to implement 'wrapping'; any shift that goes beyond the end of the alphabet should wrap
        back to the beginning ('z' shifted with a key of 3 would become 'c')
    - If you want to test your functions individually, you can comment out the 'if name == main' block
        and just call them with test arguments
