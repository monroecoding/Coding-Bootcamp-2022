2/17 Project

Create a program that allows the user to input a sentence and return
some data about it.

The data we want:
    -length of the sentence
    -the sentence in reverse (if sentence is 'hello world', print 'dlrow olleh')
    -how many times does the sentence contain the word 'the'
    -use concatenation or a formatted string to print everything out
    
Things to consider:
    -make sure to consider case (uppercase and lowercase)
    
Test cases:
    input -> This is a sentence
    output -> length: 18
              reverse: ecnetnes a si sihT
              'the' count: 0
              
    input -> The number of the day is 7
    output -> length: 26
              reverse: 7 si yad eht fo rebmun ehT
              'the' count: 2
