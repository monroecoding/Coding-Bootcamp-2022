Hangman
A simplified game of hangman where the user has 5 guesses to pick the correct letters of
a randomly selected word

You will need to complete 4 helper functions so that the main() function runs properly
First, you need to access the text file 'word_list' to return a list of all possible words
then choose one of the words randomly from that list

Next you'll need functions that check if the user has guessed the word correctly
and if not, you want to display which letters are correct

Things to remember:
    -Use the 'with' keyword when working with files, otherwise don't forget to close file manually
    -Remember that line breaks '\n' are included when reading text files
    -You can use the 'in' keyword to check if an element is present in an iterable (list, tuple, str, etc.)
    -Use for loops to cycle through an iterable
    -If you want to test individual functions, just comment out the if name == main block

Feel free to refactor the code however you want if it makes it easier for you!
